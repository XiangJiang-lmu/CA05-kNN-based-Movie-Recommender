# CA05-kNN-based-Movie-Recommender
# This is an easy model
# Firstly I have to get the data and check the data
# Then I just need to select feature and make a easy encoding for these columns, look the new dataframe though this is not used a encoding mothod
# And also I need to make the X_train data always to build the K-NN model 
# But just the model is not enough, I have to think about how to find these similar movies, so I created the function "get_similar_movies" and use this function through the K-NN model to find these movies.
# Then you can see the answer is here: The similar movie and Top 5 recommended movies, good right?
